# Morsage Fall 2016 Hackathon Project

Created by: Kevin Lee, Daniel Rosen, Ethan Hardacre, Elvis Kahoro

This app is a morse code translator for Android. Type in text or morse code,
and returns the translated morse code or text. If translated into morse code,
the phone vibrates the morse code signals with every dot and dash.

This project won 1st place at the Fall 2016 Hackathon for the 
First-Time Hacker Division.
